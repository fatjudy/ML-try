# Chapter 2: Python Basics

```{python}
# %matplotlib inline
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
plt.plot(np.random.randn(50).cumsum())
```

```{python}
# Different types of variables
a = 4.5
b = 2
c='haha'
```

```{python}
print('a is {0}, b is {1}'.format(type(a),type(b)))
```

```{python}
print('a is {0}, b is {1}, c is {2}'.format(type(a),type(b),type(c)))
```

```{python}
# To check whether a is a certain type, or one of the few types
isinstance(a,int)
```

```{python}
isinstance(a,(int,float))
```

```{python}
# String, use '' or "" to specify a string
# Use '''''' or """""" to specify a string with multiple lines
a = 'It is a crazy world'
b = """I am a PhD student in Monash
I like having spicy food
I love playing games
"""

```

```{python}
# count how many lines are there in a string
b.count('\n')
```

```{python}
# Replace part of the string
print(a.replace('crazy','stupid'))
```

```{python}
# number with scientific notation
fval = 6.78e-5
fval*100000
```

```{python}
# If you convert a string to a list, the string will be listed by single alphabet
s = 'python'
l_1 = list(s)
print(l_1)
```

```{python}
# To write a string with backslash, you need to use \\
s = '12\\23'
s
```

```{python}
# what is this r??
s = r'this\has\no\special\characters'
s
```

```{python}
# Strings can be added together
a = "He's silly "
b = 'but cute'
a+b
# They can be added to gether but there is no space. You need to add a space at the end of first string
# how to type I'm, seems that I can use ""

```

### Date in python: datatime module

```{python}
from datetime import datetime, date, time
```

```{python}
dt = datetime(2020,4,3,20, 26, 37) # In the brackets, they are year, month, date, hour, min, and second respectively
```

```{python}
dt.date()
```

```{python}
dt.year
```

```{python}
# Convert time to string
dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y %H:%M')
```

```{python}
# Convert string to time
datetime.strptime('20091031', '%Y%m%d')
```

```{python}
# Replace some parts of the date with 0
dt.replace(minute=0, second=0)
```

```{python}
# Difference between times can be calculated by "-"
dt1 = datetime(2011,10,29,20,30,21)
delta = dt - dt1
delta
```

```{python}
# range(10): start from 0 to 10
# range(start, end, interval)
range(10)
```

### Ternary expressions

```{python}
# It allows you to combine an if-else block that produces a value into a single line or expression
# Syntax is given by:
```

#### value = true-expr if condition else false-expr

```{python}
x = 5
'Non-negative' if x >= 0 else 'Negative'
```

# Chapter 3 Built-in Data Structires, Functions, and Files

```{python}

```
